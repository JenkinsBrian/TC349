I like the etsy website. It is very clean, and the simple white color scheme
makes everything easy to read. The prices are also easy to find. This is 
a problem I have with a lot of other online stores.

The problems I see with the site, are that I think they should have the top 
bar look more professional, the top left has just plain looking buttons
for gift card, blog etc. They could make those look a lot better rather
easily.
