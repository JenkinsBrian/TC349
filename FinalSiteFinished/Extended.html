		<h2>The Rest of The Clan</h2>
		<h3>The only other Jenkins in the United States, are the Pinckney flock, which can be seen in th red coat and the backwards hat. These are our two cousins. My aunt and Uncle are not pictured. They are taking the picture. We also have Uncle Mark who is not pictured in this photograph. The 10 Jenkins in the United States make up the entire family. We have other relatives, but we are the only ones keeping the name alive.</h3>
