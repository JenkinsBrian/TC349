		<h2>The Origin Story of The Jenkins Family</h2>
		<h3>The story of the Jenkins Family begins with my great grandfather, who oddly enough was actually named William Jenkin, not Jenkins. When he came over to The United States from England, The officials at Ellis Island wrote his name down wrong and he did not want to risk not getting in by bringing up the mistake. This means that any Jenkins in The United States, our family is not necessarily related too. My Great Grandfather came over to America and went to work in the Upper Peninsula in the mines. When World War I broke out, The British Army offered to pay the expenses of any British Male citizen living over seas that wanted to come back and fight for their country, My grandfather took the offer and returned home to fight. While fighting he was unfortunately mustard gassed in combat. While recovering in the hospital he met my great grandmother, who coincidentally was also his nurse. After his recovery they moved back to Michigan and started a family, as he was Royally Discharged from the British Army, by the crown due to his heroic efforts during the war. He would later go on to have a son, who of course is my Grandfather, and that is how the Jenkins Family got itâ€™s start in America.</h3>
