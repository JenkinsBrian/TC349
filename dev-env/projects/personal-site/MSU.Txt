I wish that this homepage had more information for current students. Also I feel it could have more
for incoming students. There are already so many sites that give us news about the university.

I do like all the visuals on the page though. They do a good job of using the MSU Branding to make
it look official and professional. I think they should focus more on our campus though when showing MSU
it seems like they look more for whats going on off campus.
