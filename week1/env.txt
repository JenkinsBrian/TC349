I went with the same Development set up that will be used in the video, that way I can learn a new environment, and it will be easier to follow along with the videos during the semester if I am using the same environment. I have some experience using Dreamweaver, I work as a Web/PR manager for MSU Greenline where we manage our organizations website using Dreamweaver. So I  wanted to use textmate, so I couldn't go into the side view, and cheat basically.

I think this set up will give me the best chance to succeed in this class, I have never used Git or Github before so I want to have as much similarity as possible so I can succeed.
