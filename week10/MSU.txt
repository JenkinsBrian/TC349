I like MSU's mobile site a lot from a student perspective. It has everything I need right in front of me with no need to scroll or go through links to find it. That is the most annoying thing about mobile sites for me is when I have to navigate to much. There is no navigation necesary in this design.

I I do think it looks a bit generic though, the buttons could be images or a bit more MSU specific. I think that is a bit nit picky though. also It kind of scared me that I could search for myself and get my information so easy, but that is a topic not meeant for this. Overall this is a very well designed site and it is something that I will be using in the future.
