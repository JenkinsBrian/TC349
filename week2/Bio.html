	<h1>Brian Jenkins</h1>
	<p>My name is Brian Jenkins I am a Media and Information student. I work at MSU Greenline as a PR/Media Assistant Manager. I am currently a junior. I am most interested in the strategy of how to use new types of media, like Facebook, twitter and other forms of media to increase a business's success. I have relevant experience working my current job, I am learning a lot about Web Development, and Public Relations/Marketing/Advertising. My skill set I pick up from my job and classes like this will help me to land a job. I have a large interest in reading, and activites like golf or baseball. While I have been horrible at completing these assignments on time, this will be the last assignment that I turn in late this semester. I really strive to do the best possible work that I can.  </p>
	<h2>Panic Critique </h2>
	<p>The Panic website, is very simple. It is very easy on the eyes and has links to everything you might need easily accessible. There is very little clutter.</p>
	<p> I do feel though that the site is almost to simplistic, When I get to the site I am not exactly sure what I am looking at, the buttons don't have great identifiers of what the products are unless you already know them before hand. I really only knew what Transmit was. also they need to have all the most important information more toward the top of the page I feel like</p>
