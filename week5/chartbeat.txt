The first thing I thought about when I visited the Chartbeat site was “What am I looking at ?”. I thought the site layout was a bit confusing and I wasn’t sure where my eye was supposed to go right off the bat. They have a cool spinning logo on the side, but that drew my eyes away from the text on the left, that I think would have better explained the image on the right. I think the image on the write needs to have more that makes it catch my eye.

I also think the actually content is confusing they nee to make it known what they are in the first 5 seconds of me being on the site in my opinion and I don’t think they do that at all. They need a new slogan “Real-Time data for front line doers I do not think helps explain their product enough. Data for what? Personally I’m not even sure if I am someone who would be on the “front-Line” or not.

I do like the color layout and how smooth the site looks, The graphis are top notch and crisp.  It looks very professional but has the look of something simplistic that anyone can use if they want to. I think that will draw a lot of people to want to learn more. The great design of the images and background, make up for the flaws I mentioned earlier.
