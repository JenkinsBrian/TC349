	<h1>Fold.Me Card Sort</h1>
		
	<h2> My Explanation</h2>
    	<p> Below I have the results from my Card Sorting project, the first card sort I did myself, and the remaining three I had my roommates do. I was very difficult for me to separate myself from the website seeing as I had been on it quite a bit, and understood how it was set up. I did my best to attempt to do my card sort as if I were setting up the website fresh. </p>
		<p>One thing I did find was I started to see how I think of things only with a very traditional top of the page navigation bar.  When I think about a design of a website I always think about 5 big buttons at the top, or at least when I think about how I would design one. This site I think showed me that there are other ways to do that then just that traditional way I think about it. I never had a problem finding things on the site, and it made the site have a lot more appeal to the eye, to have things in a more non-traditional format.</p>
        <p>I did not get a ton of feedback from my roommates as they did it, they found it a bit 			difficult, which I was expecting, but once I told them not to worry and just do it they came up with 		some results that I can see and definitely understand. I had one comment that I was missing a section to put things under, referring to the social media buttons. I think if I were actually doing the design I would ignore this because those buttons are really what those cards are at the bottom of the home page. The only other thing I noticed was John and Tyler both had similar Sorts, this could be because Tyler sort of watched John do it, I would need to do more testing to really prove if it had an affect though. Instead of repeating the results of all the card sorts, I have them in images down below.
