I really like the color layout of Happy Cog, it draws your eye right to the top, where they also have a nice description of what their company does. They also place more information down below that isnâ€™t completely centered so that you have to scroll down. I think this actually is a good look for this website. It makes things bold,.

There are not a lot of moving parts on the website, the design is very simple. I think I would make navigation a little more obvious it took me a minute to find everything I was looking for . Other then that again I think it is very well laid out. Which you would expect from a company like this.
