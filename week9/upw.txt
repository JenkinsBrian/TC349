The first thing I started to compare this site to was, Jackthreads.com . A site that I frequently visit to by clothing and things like that. In comparison I think this site is very lacking. it doesn't look as cool or new age it Looks like something that was quickly put together to sell T-shirts. That being said it serves that purpose so that does say something. I would prefer to see something without a plain white background and maybe a better explanation of what the website actually is for.

I also think it is to cluttered when you first get here,if I didn't know what united pixel workers was, and I don't, Although as I wrote that and looked back I do notice the podcast link to the "origin story" which may be helpful. I think that the simplistic format is a good idea, but when you put tons of pictures on a simplistic template I don't think that works very well.
